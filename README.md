# RTE_resource_directory_map

## An interactive map for the resource directory component in RTE's new website.

### Attention:

#### 1. We use Mapbox as the mapping environment. So a mapbox token is needed in map.js to initiate the map. Please follow instructions in Mapbox's websites to acquire a token.

#### 2. The "description" features in many geojson files are set as None for now - so there won't be any info displayed in the pop-ups when users interact with company points. Please include company info as well as logos/websites in the future.

#### 3. Please refer to Mapbox websites for detailed coding instructions (styling, pop-ups, etc.)
